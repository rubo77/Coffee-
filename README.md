# Coffee++ keyboardlayout

(free under GNU-Licence by Ruben Barkow) 

### A one-hand typing keyboardlayout for programmers that can be used optional with both-hands

 

This layout enables you to type complete texts and code **only with your left hand** , leaves your right hand free for the mouse, numberpad or just drinking coffee.

Additionally the most common letters **E,N,T** and **I** are repeated on the right hand side of the keyboard to increase your typing speed. If both hands are used, you can reach a much **faster typing speed** than with the QWERT-layout.

Designed especially for programmers or people, that have to type a lot of special characters like komma, `", =, [, ], &lt;, &gt;, ', -, ., $, /, +, *,` ( and ) .

Unlike the [Left-Hand-Dvorak-Layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard#One-handed_versions) in the Coffee++ layout the left hand is positioned normal at the standard-left position.

-    The common characters A,S and D are at the same position as in QWERT-layouts (as well as B, Z, -, comma, period and @).
-    Numbers are reached only with the AltGr-Key (because they are repeated on the numberpad anyway) and are rearranged so the most common numbers 0 and 1 are easy to reach
-    Special characters are reached directly on your right side (without Shift) and additionally on the left side with the AltGr-key (for left-hand-writing)
-    The Caps-Lock Key is replaced by a **second AltGr-Key** and banned to the (useless?) Scroll-Lock Key
-    with the AltGr-Key pressed you can use the right hand in the standard position to navigate through text
-    the letters C, X, V, W, A, S and Z are kept easy to reach, for use in applications with the Control-Key

[Portable ENTI-key++V21.zip](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pkl/Portable_ENTI-key_0-2.zip) (thanks to [Máté Farkas](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=28447))

with this Tool, you have the full AltGr-functionality. (Just add 'pkl.exe' to your autostart)


Alternatively you can use your **Caps Lock Key** as **AltGr-Key** with [KeyTweak](http://webpages.charter.net/krumsick/) and this Codepage:

[CapsLock2AltGr_ScrollLock2CapsLock.ktw.zip](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/CapsLock2AltGr_ScrollLock2CapsLock.ktw.zip)

or use your **Caps Lock Key** as Left **Backspace** with this Codepage:

[CapsLock2BackspaceScrollLock2CapsLock.ktw.zip](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/CapsLock2BackspaceScrollLock2CapsLock.ktw.zip)

If you have a mouse with extra buttons, it is usefull to set one of the extra buttons to AltGr.

### Linux  ![Linux|20x20](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/pics/20x20xlinux.jpg.pagespeed.ic.5a4MYFyfFe.jpg)
On **Ubuntu** , follow [these instructions](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=13&amp;p=34#p34)

I also generated the [.xmodmap](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/.xmodmap-ENTI-key++) file from the **MS** **Keyboard Layout Creator** Map with this conversion tool i developed: [klc2xmodmap](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/klc2xmodmap/xmodmap2.php).

#### Mac OS
Download the layout (which was created with Ukulele) and copy it as root into the folder

    ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/Coffee++.keylayout

Open your Keyboart settings and add the Layout Coffee++ there.

For more detailed infos see the instruction at http://wiki.neo-layout.org/wiki/Neo%20auf%20dem%20Apple%20Macintosh%20einrichten which works the same way.

[Tips for learning](http://colemak.com/Learn#Tips_for_learning)
You can easily learn on [www.10-fast-fingers.com](http://10-fast-fingers.com/) 

Or you use your favorite typing tutor and add this [course](http://coffeeplusplus.z11.de/course.txt)

 

you should print the Coffee++ Layout before you start the course, cause the finger-animation inside the course usually doesen´t work correctly
