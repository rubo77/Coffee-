# Coffee++ keyboardlayout


(free under GNU-Licence by Ruben Barkow)

 

A one-hand typing keyboardlayout for programmers that can be used optional with both-hands

 

This layout enables you to type complete texts and code only with your left hand, leaves your right hand free for the mouse, numberpad or just drinking coffee.

Additionally the most common letters E,N,T and I are repeated on the right hand side of the keyboard to increase your typing speed. If both hands are used, you can reach a much faster typing speed than with the QWERT-layout.

Designed especially for programmers or people, that have to type a lot of special characters like komma, `", =, [, ], <, >, ', -, ., $, /, +, *`, ( and ) 

Unlike the Left-Hand-Dvorak-Layout in the Coffee++ layout the left hand is positioned normal at the standard-left position.
